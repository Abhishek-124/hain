### Documenation Todo List:

 - [x] Incorporate Guides into typedoc build process
 - [x] Expand on documentation with examples, samples & links
 - [x] **BUG**: ++Overlapping Legend/Left Menu / Content++
 - [x] synchronize with existing documentation
 - [ ] Create/Upload official @types/hain-plugin
 - [ ] hain-0.6.0 reference be pulled in from latest API version?
 - [ ] Have gulp build "Available Plugins" page
 - [ ] Have gulp file download from official source and build (... onchange?)
 - [ ] Create Plugin Skeleton Project?
 - [ ] Pop-over Type Aliases?


### Typedoc
 - [ ] [[include:xyz.md]] from within markdown doesn't work
 - [ ] Why doesn't [[Icon URL Format|Icon URL Format]] work?
    - Consider adding check against "originalName" as a quick fix.
